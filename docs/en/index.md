### 1. Introduction: What is BlocksTimer For?
BlocksTimer is an advanced interval timer designed to be flexible and powerful. Unlike traditional timers, it allows you to build complex workouts by assembling different "blocks," each with its own rules (work, rest, rounds, cycles).

**Key Strengths:**
- **Modularity:** Build complex workouts like time pyramids or multi-phase sessions.
- **Customization:** Assign a unique name and color to each workout to recognize it at a glance.
- **Organization:** Group your favorite workouts into Collections (e.g., "Warm-ups," "HIIT," "Tabata").

### 2. The Main Screen: Your Workout List
This is the heart of the app, where all your saved workouts are displayed.

- **Add Workout (+):** The floating button at the bottom right lets you create a new timer from scratch.
- **Start a Workout:** Tap the play button on any workout card to jump directly into the session.
- **Filters:** The tabs at the top allow you to filter your workouts by Collection. Tap "All" to see every workout you've created.
- **Options Menu (⋮):** Each workout has a menu with three options:
    - **Edit:** Modify the workout's name, color, and blocks.
    - **Associate:** Link or unlink the workout from one or more collections.
    - **Delete:** Permanently remove the workout.

### 3. Creating and Editing a Workout
When you create a new workout, the first step is to give it a name and choose a color. Once confirmed, you can start adding the blocks that will make up your session.

- **Name and Color:** Give your workout a unique identity.
- **Add Block:** This opens a dialog where you can define the block type and its timings.
- **Reorder Blocks:** Long-press and drag a block to change its position in the workout sequence.

### 4. Understanding Block Types
BlocksTimer offers three distinct types of blocks to build versatile workouts.

- **Intervals:** The classic block with settings for **Work**, **Rest**, **Rounds**, and **Cycles**. It also includes a "Rest Between Cycles" option for recovery in multi-cycle sets. A round value of "0" means infinite rounds.
- **Stopwatch:** A simple count-up timer. It runs indefinitely until you manually skip to the next block. Perfect for "AMRAP" (As Many Rounds As Possible) or "For Time" workouts.
- **Manual Pause:** This special block pauses the timer and waits for your input to continue. It's useful for planned breaks, equipment changes, or any un-timed transition in your workout.

### 5. Running a Workout: The Player
The player screen is designed for clarity and ease of use during an intense session.

- **Main Display:** Shows the current stage (Work, Rest, etc.) and the remaining time.
- **Controls:**
    - **Play/Pause:** Start or pause the timer.
    - **Stop:** Opens a confirmation dialog to end the workout session.
    - **Skip:** Immediately jumps to the next stage in the sequence.
- **Stats:** At the bottom, you can track your progress through **Rounds** and **Cycles**.
- **Total Progress Bar:** This bar at the bottom shows your overall progress through the entire workout.

### 6. Organizing with Collections
Collections are like folders for your workouts, helping you keep everything tidy.

From the main screen's navigation drawer, select "Collections" to manage them. Here you can:
- **Create New Collections:** Give a name to a new group (e.g., "Leg Day").
- **View Workouts:** Expand a collection to see all the workouts it contains and start them directly.
- **Delete Collections:** Remove a collection (this does not delete the workouts inside it).

You can associate a workout with a collection from the workout's option menu on the main screen.

### 7. Quick Settings
You can access quick settings from the navigation drawer on the main screen.

- **Keep Screen On:** When enabled, this prevents your device's screen from turning off during a workout.
- **Sound:** Toggles all app sounds, including countdown beeps and stage transition alerts.
